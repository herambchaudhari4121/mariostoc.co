# My First Kayak
<time datetime="2013-02-11">Monday, February 11, 2013</time>

Throwing a backpack over my shoulders and getting out to explore nature is
something I love to do.  Living on Vancouver Island is the perfect place for
this sort of activity.  Kayaking may be a natural extension to hiking and a
kayak should get me to into places that I have yet to explore.

There is a catch.  Unlike hiking, kayaking, the ocean and all that encompasses
the two are very new things to me.

I have been digesting all sorts of information about different makes and models
of kayaks.  What I believe I want, is a boat that can pack my outdoor gear, and
allow me to efficiently go further in a day's paddle.

Today I purchased this all black, carbon fibre, Looksha Elite.  The boat feels
like there is more there than I might be able to handle right now; this is an
exciting proposition for me.  I am not just going to sit in it and move my arms
a little.  I might have to develop a new skill set.
