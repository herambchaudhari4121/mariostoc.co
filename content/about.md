# About

Hi, I'm Mario Stocco.

On this site, you will find some articles I've written, some photos that I've taken and a little about me.

I can also be found at Strava and Garmin as I run, bike and swim in preparation to complete my first Ironman triathlon.

I am currently a Solutions Engineer at Distributel Communications in Canada, working on a number of initiatives around our best-in-market telecommunications platform.  I live and work in Victoria, British Columbia and I am engaged to the sweetest woman ever!

Before Distributel, I spent more than a decade as a contractor for hire, building custom call centre solutions for customers in Florida, Nevada and California.
