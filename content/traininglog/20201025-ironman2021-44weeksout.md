## WEEKLY GOAL

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 15 minutes.  
Run 80 minutes: 20 minutes easy running to warm up. 5x :40 strides, 1:20 EASY jog after each. Then... 4x 9 minutes @ 1/2 marathon effort/focus (flatter road, Lochside/Goose would be ideal) 1:00 WALK between each. 10 minutes easy running to cool down.  **BRING CALORIES**

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **15 km**

I had a much better sleep last night compared to what I was getting last week.

I felt today's mobility routine in my legs (lunges in particular).

I walked for a bit before hitting start on this run.  I felt just ok at the pedestrian pace of the warm up and I headed toward the gravel part of _Lochside Trail_ just north of the _Monkey Tree Pub_.

Once there, it was time for 5 strides and all 5 of them felt terrible; heavy legs, no juice.  

Then, out of nowhere, things just clicked on the 9 minute efforts.   Running felt **light and effortless**.  I was expecting to go through the motions but all of a sudden I was having a lot of fun.  I had a _"coffee flavoured"_ ReKarb between the 3rd and 4th efforts.

It was a comfortable jog home from there.

### PACE CHART

I wore my Altras tonight as I developed a bit of an ingrown toenail on my left big toe.  I addressed it before the run but this may have been my most fun activity in those shoes so far.
