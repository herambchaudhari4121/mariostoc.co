## SUNDAY SEP 20
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes  
Ride 1:30-1:45. Flatter ride on the road bike. 
If your MTB is up and rolling, I'm very much ok with this being an 80-90 minute fun MTB ride on some dirt roads/trails.

### NOTES
Total Time: **120 minutes**

There was an option for a MTB ride an I took it after an inspection of the front wheel on the road bike.  Before I headed out, I had a flat to repair; that caused a nasty gash across 2 fingers.  Grrrr...

I headed out toward Thetis without much of a plan except to be out for 90 minutes.  The park was busy with people.  I skipped my favourite single track and took the fire road to the base of Mount Stewart.  By that point, I had been pedalling for 40 minutes.  
<!---->
From the base, I walked my bike up the steep sections until I got to the summit. After a bit of time soaking in the sunshine, I headed back down to Scafe Hill, then to Bellamy and the fireroad route out of Thetis Lake Park.

I took it easy as I am naturally fatigued from yesterdayâ€™s effort.  This was **a really fun ride** and as the trails are dry (for now)

I had a so-so sleep last night even though the Seahawk beat the Patriots with a defensive stand on the last play.  I am particularly tight in my left hip and need time with the lacrosse ball to get the tissue to calm down.
