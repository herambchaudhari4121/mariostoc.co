# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning Sunday, August 30, 2020

**52 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This week is going to be all about an emotional reset for me.  There are no planned workouts and if I do any exercise, it will be for the enjoyment of the activity itself, rather than any training stimulus it provides.  

## SUMMARY
I feel like was... <!--OVERTRAINING|ON THE EDGE|STAYING CONSISTENT|LAGGING A BIT-->

### PLANNED WORKOUT
No planned workout.

### NOTES

This was a day to reflect on life.  I had no desire to talk to anyone, be anywhere or do anything.  I did write the software that will power this website today though.  It is not done yet but it is getting close!

### PLANNED WORKOUT
No planned workout.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I overslept and had an rough day concentrating on work.  Things come and go and sometimes I have good moments of focus and other times, work seems overwhelming.  I watched a video detailing Challenge Davos and it provided a glimpse of what I might expect for a race experience next summer.  I also read that Jen Annett posted a 10 hour time on the Penticton course over the weekend in an “unofficial” event of about a dozen locals.
