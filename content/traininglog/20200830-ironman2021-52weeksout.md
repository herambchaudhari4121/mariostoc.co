# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning Sunday, August 30, 2020

**52 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This week is going to be all about an emotional reset for me.  There are no planned workouts and if I do any exercise, it will be for the enjoyment of the activity itself, rather than any training stimulus it provides.

## SUMMARY
I feel like was... <!--OVERTRAINING|ON THE EDGE|STAYING CONSISTENT|LAGGING A BIT-->

This was a day to reflect on life.  I had no desire to talk to anyone, be anywhere or do anything.  I did write the software that will power this website today though.  It is not done yet but it is getting close!

I would like to think that the weather being cold, gray and then rainy had a less than positive effect on my overall mood.

### PLANNED WORKOUT

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I overslept and had an rough day concentrating on work.  Things come and go and sometimes I have good moments of focus and other times, work seems overwhelming.  I watched a video detailing Challenge Davos and it provided a glimpse of what I might expect for a race experience next summer.  I also read that Jen Annett posted a 10 hour time on the Penticton course over the weekend in an "unofficial" event of about a dozen locals.

This would have been my father's 79th birthday.  Enough said.

I was awake from 2:30 to 5:30am and had a bit of a headache too.  I did a walk/jog around Swan Lake and that helped.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
No planned workout.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

Lumbar and traps are still TAF and I need to continue to work on that.  It does feel like a bit of emotional weight has lifted; my energy is better today.  I had a better sleep last night too.

I did get in a short run in after dinner.  I felt good at a steady but easy pace.  I wore my old Nike Peg Turbos without socks and it felt great for the first 3.5K; I did start to feel a blister coming on and for that reason alone, I stopped running at just over 5K.  I walked home from there.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
No planned workout.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

First time to talk with Elliot since both our worlds recently changed.  I am feeling a bit more motivated to getting moving again.
There are still lingering moments of inability to concentrate; which is ok for now but can't be forever.
I am hoping that I can focus long enough to reduce my current load at work, thus leaving more mental energy to get outside.
