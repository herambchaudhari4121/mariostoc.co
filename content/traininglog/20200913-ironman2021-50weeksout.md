# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning Sunday, September 13, 2020

**50 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
I am expecting the smoky skies to clear this week and get back 
to putting some consistency into into my fitness.  This is 
another week to build on good habits and get a test of where 
I am at.

## SUNDAY SEP 13
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 20 minutes: Swimmer's Routine  
Run 50-55 minutes. Easy effort. Hilly route. On trails is great, but not mandatory.

### NOTES
Total Time: **60 minutes**

Another very smoky day, another day waking up not feeling rested and a headache worthy of an 200mg Advil.

I rolled out the yoga mat and got a good stretch in.  Swimmer's routine showed me that my neck and traps are very tender, that my pecs and hamstrings are tight (but not sore) and that my hip flexors and quads have decent mobility.

With the smoke lingering, I substituted the 55 minute run with a 90 minute walk down to (and up from)
[McKenzie Bight](/pictures/victoria/mckenzie-bight "McKenzie Bight") with Carina.  
Distance: **5.7 km** &nbsp; Elevation: **240 m**

## MONDAY SEP 14
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes  
Run 30 minutes. Flat route. EASY effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I was up really early (4am) so I checked in on a few things at work.  That early start meant I got a morning nap between 06:30 and 08:00; from there I was ready to take on the Monday.

Flexibility Routine V3! showed me that my hamstrings are tight and the straddle positions at the end of the routine were challenging too.  My quads, adductors and hipflexors are GTG.

Today was another smoky day but a light started at 16:30; hopefully that will clear out the air.

## TUESDAY SEP 15
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 1:00-1:15. Easy spin on the road bike. If you are crunched for time... 45-60 minutes of easy spinning on the rollers. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **50 minutes**

I had an _"ok"_ sleep last night but today was a bit of a frustrating day at work as I did get myself into a grumpy state by not stopping for lunch at a decent time.

I did 50 minutes of steady state pedalling this evening, using the road bike on the rollers.  The top of my right knee cap was _mildly tender_ through the first 24 minutes and from then on, everything felt good.  At least until the saddle started to become noticable after ~40 minutes. The tire pressure was low for rollers so (I think) it was a good workout. I chose rollers over outside because of the lingering smoke in the air.

## WEDNESDAY SEP 16
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 22 minutes  
Run 40 minutes: 15 minutes easy running to warm up. 10x :40 strides, 1:20 easy jog after each. HR should drop fairly close to your easy run HR by the start of the next stride. (with in 5-10 beats) If it's not, then stride slower. 5 minutes easy to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **- minutes**

Sleep last night was ok but I did wake up feeling congested and with a stiff neck.

I got the run in after work this evening.  Weird day as it looked like the smoke was going to lift in the morning but it got thicker as the afternoon wore on.  The last of the sun was visible as a dim, crimson dot in the sky at 17:45 and gone completely by 18:00.  Regardless, I put on an N95 dust mask and headed out.

This was one of those runs that felt good in the beginning but 
as soon as the work started, I really wished that I had put in 
some real training last weekend.  Regardless, I made it _"Last 
stride, best stride"_ and enjoyed a walk for the final 1:20 
recovery period.

I have to say, running with a mask sure had me aware of my 
breathing.

Distance: **7.5 km** &nbsp; Pace: **5:35/km**

I did the Cyclist Flexibility Routine after the run; which 
served to highlight my asymetries!
