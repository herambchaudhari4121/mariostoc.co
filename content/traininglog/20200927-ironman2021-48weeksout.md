## WEDNESDAY SEP 30
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 12 minutes | Run: Track

* 15 minutes easy to warm up. 
* 5x 100 meter strides a touch slower than 5k effort, 100 meter EASY jog. 
* 3x 300 @ 5k effort/pace. 1:17-1:21 is a good goal. 100 meter WALK. This is all a warm up. Going faster will only hurt the actual workout. 
* 20 minutes tempo @ 1/2 marathon effort/feel. Please try and keep things under control. Especially the first 2k or so. 
* 15 minutes easy running to cool down.
