# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, September 27, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(3);)

**48 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Heading into this week, I feel like I have some momentum from the consistancy from [last week](ironman2021-49weeksout).  The brick workout on [Tuesday](javascript:flkty.select(5);) and the track workout on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(7);) look to be important days.  My goal is to nail those workouts and enjoy the balance of the activities scheduled this week.

## SUNDAY SEP 27 ðŸŒ¥
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 20 minutes  
Run 70 minutes. Hilly route. On trails would be nice. But not 
mandatory. Keep the effort EASY. And bring a gel. Always good 
to practice.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **12 km**

Today was a mostly cloudy, humid, 15&#8451;.  I headed out on my Helmcken route with the idea of adding in few more undulations.   This was a pretty routine, **easy effort run**; I kept it controlled on the uphills and comfortable everywhere else. I enjoyed a packet of _"Macha LattÃ©"_ flavoured ReKarb at the 40 minute mark; it sat ok with me.  I started to feel a bout of heavy legs for the final 10 minutes; meaning coach nailed the right amount of run for today.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
22 Minute Full Body Mobility Routine V3.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Early to bed last night and I had a solid night's sleep.  Regardless, I still feeling yesterday's run in my legs this morning.

By 16:00 and after being on the computer all day, I looked out the window at the nice weather and thought about how nice it would be to get a run in.  I passed knowing that I have a plan for [tomorrow](javascript:flkty.select(5);) and [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(7);).

Today was a **recovery day**.

## TUESDAY SEP 29 â˜€
Sleep **4** | Fatigue **2** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers ~ 60 minutes. Easy spinning. You can head outside if you 
like. But this is to save some time.   
Run (can be directly before or after the ride) 30 minutes. Flat 
route. Easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes**

I did not sleep that well last night; maybe to much time on the keyboard yesterday.  My neck and left hip feel stiff and I will hit the foam roller before heading out on the ride.

The weather couldn't have been nicer.  Seriously today was nicer than a typical summer day.  It would have been a waste to have ridden the rollers this afternoon.  That being said, I really didn't have a route planned so I hopped on the TT bike and pedalled.  I ended up doing the Dallas Road/Beach Drive route.  No real focus except to enjoy the sunshine.

I did stop for a bit to say hello to an old hockey buddy who was out for a walk.  This was very much an **easy ride** and I did put back a 750ml bottle with 53g of Gatorade while being out on the road.

Getting back home, I didn't waste much time getting into the Nikes and heading out towards Quadra.  Quads, hammies and glutes felt ok but my soleus' were pretty lit up and my ankles (Fibularis Tertius) were sore too.  The soreness did begin to calm down after about 25 minutes (on a false flat, downhill).  This run OTB was a **focus on form** type of effort.

Ride Distance: **27 km** &nbsp; Moving Time: **1:07:00**

## WEDNESDAY SEP 30
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **4** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 12 minutes | Run: Track

* 15 minutes easy to warm up.
* 5x 100 meter strides a touch slower than 5k effort, 100 meter EASY jog.
* 3x 300 @ 5k effort/pace. 1:17-1:21 is a good goal. 100 meter WALK. This is all a warm up. Going faster will only hurt the actual workout.
* 20 minutes tempo @ 1/2 marathon effort/feel. Please try and keep things under control. Especially the first 2k or so.
* 15 minutes easy running to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I had a decent sleep last night.

The hip mobility routine was done just before heading to the track.  It help me work out some stiffness in my adductors that I didn't know were tight... Interesting.

So I had a bit of a build up ever since I saw this run workout hit my inbox.  It was NOT another attempts at 12.5 laps but it is a chance to nail some paces on the track.  The warm up went ok; my soleus' took their time to loosen up and they did before the first set of 100s.  The 5x100 may have been the trickiest for me to get right as before I had a chance to settle into a pace, the effort was over.  The 3x300 on the other hand came in as **1:19.2**, **1:19.4** and **1:20.1** with the last one feeling the easiest.

The 20 minute tempo was run at my most consistent effort of **5:05/km**.  This may be a touch faster than the 1/2 Marathon pace but it was less than my 10K effort.  It was a rhythm that I found easy to lock into an stay at for 20 minutes.
