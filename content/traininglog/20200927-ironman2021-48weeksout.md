# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, September 27, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(2);)

**48 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
Heading into this week, I feel like I have some momentum from the consistancy from [last week](ironman2021-49weeksout).  The brick workout on [Tuesday](javascript:flkty.select(4);) and the track workout on [Wednesday](javascript:flkty.select(5);) look to be important days.  My goal is to nail those workouts and enjoy the balance of the activities scheduled this week.

## SUNDAY SEP 27 ðŸŒ¥
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 20 minutes  
Run 70 minutes. Hilly route. On trails would be nice. But not 
mandatory. Keep the effort EASY. And bring a gel. Always good 
to practice.

### NOTES
Total Time: **70 minutes**

Today was mostly cloudy and a humid, 15&#8451;.  I headed out on my Helmcken route with the idea of adding in few more undulations.   This was a pretty routine, _"easy effort"_ run; I kept it controlled on the uphills and comfortable everywhere else.
I enjoyed a packet of _"Macha LattÃ©"_ flavoured ReKarb at the 40 minute mark; it sat ok with me.  I started to feel a bout of heavy legs for the final 10 minutes; meaning coach nailed the right amount of run for today.

Rollers ~ 60 minutes. Easy spinning. You can head outside if you 
like. But this is to save some time.

## WEDNESDAY SEP 30
Sleep **-** | Fatigue **-** | Stress **-** | Soreness **-**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 12 minutes | Run: Track

* 15 minutes easy to warm up.
* 5x 100 meter strides a touch slower than 5k effort, 100 meter EASY jog.
* 3x 300 @ 5k effort/pace. 1:17-1:21 is a good goal. 100 meter WALK. This is all a warm up. Going faster will only hurt the actual workout.
* 20 minutes tempo @ 1/2 marathon effort/feel. Please try and keep things under control. Especially the first 2k or so.
* 15 minutes easy running to cool down.

Total Time: **0 minutes**
