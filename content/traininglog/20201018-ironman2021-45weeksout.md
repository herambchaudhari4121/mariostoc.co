# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, October 18, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(2);)

**45 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This training week looks similar to [last week](ironman2021-46weeksout).  This is a great opportunity to **be consistent**.  My goal is to handle the front half of this week better so that it doesn't negatively effect the back half.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 18 minutes.  
Run 90 minutes. Hilly route. Maybe some trails?? 
Remember to bring calories. Keep the effort EASY. Time on feet. Nothing more.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I woke up and had a nice, lazy morning.  I did the mobility mid-afternoon and headed out for the run later.

I started off slow, easy and not in a rush.  This was a shorter version of last Sunday's hilly route through View Royal.  I felt pretty darn good for the first 20 minutes; I was expecting worse.  I made a mental note at the 36 minute mark that my legs were starting to fade; not much juice going up and a bit more impact on the way down.

By the time I hit _Helmcken Road_, things started to perk up and by the time I got half way back to _Admirals Road_, I was popping off the ground as if I had rested for a week.

Even though I was out there for less time than last Sunday's run, I came within a kilometre in distance and ten metres of elevation gain of last week.  The sunny weather window I had today may have helped a bit too.
