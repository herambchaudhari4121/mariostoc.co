# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021
Week beginning [Sunday, October 18, 2020](javascript:flkty.select(2);)

**45 weeks** until IRONMAN Canada.

## WEEKLY GOAL
This training week looks similar to [last week](ironman2021-46weeksout).  This is a great opportunity to **be consistent**.  My goal is to handle the front half of this week better so that it doesn't negatively effect the back half.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 18 minutes.  
Run 90 minutes. Hilly route. Maybe some trails?? 
Remember to bring calories. Keep the effort EASY. Time on feet. Nothing more.

### NOTES
Total Time: **94 minutes** &nbsp; Distance **15 km**

I woke up and had a nice, lazy morning.  I did the mobility mid-afternoon and headed out for the run later.

I started off slow, easy and not in a rush.  This was a shorter version of last Sunday's hilly route through View Royal.  I felt pretty darn good for the first 20 minutes; I was expecting worse.  I made a mental note at the 36 minute mark that my legs were starting to fade; not much juice going up and a bit more impact on the way down.
<!---->
By the time I hit _Helmcken Road_, things started to perk up and by the time I got half way back to _Admirals Road_, I was **popping off the ground** as if I had rested for a week.

Even though I was out there for less time than last Sunday's run, I came within a kilometre in distance and ten metres of elevation gain of last week.  The sunny weather window I had today may have helped a bit too.

I finished this run with a great runner's high.

A night of sound sleep.  Hooray!

Good day in the office. Hooray!

This was a welcomed **recovery** day.

I did have a moment in the evening where I found myself really missing my dad.  I don't know if that was a product of not having a training day or if this is just part of the grieving process.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Rollers 60 minutes: 30 minutes easy. 12x :45 high cadence, :45 easy after each. 12 minutes easy riding to finish up.   
Run 30 minutes flat and easy. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I slept well through 4:15am before I was awake.  Fortunately I was able to fall back asleep and then slept in to 8am.

A new heart rate monitor strap came in today so I can start recording that metric more precisely (especially [tomorrow](javascript:flkty.select(7);)).

Busy day at work and a small woodworking task took up most of the daylight today.  I was debating whether to go for a spin outside but was happy to put on a YouTube video and ride in the garage.  
<!---->
For the cadence work on the bike, I focused on being **smooth** rather than hitting a specific RPM.  I think this worked out okay as I stayed in control and stayed on the rollers.  I drank a full bottle mixed with 36 grams of Gatorade (135 calories) over the course of the hour.

I was in my Altras and out the door without much time wasted.  I **felt okay**; not bad, not great, just okay.  2 things I noticed on the run tonight:

* It is now getting cool enough for a long sleeved shirt on a clear night like tonight.
* I am still missing my dad.

Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 10 minutes easy to warm up. 5x 100 meter strides (Controlled, just to warm up) 100 meter EASY jog. Then... 15 minutes @ 1/2 marathon effort. NOT TOO HARD. 5:08-5:15 pace. Walk 3-4 minutes. Then...
8x 400 meters @ 1:42 -1:45. Certainly do not go faster than this. Practicing pacing. Even 200 splits would be ideal. Leaving on 3:00. 10 minute EASY jog to cool down.

### NOTES
Total Time: **68 minutes**

I had another night of waking up in the middle of the night though I feel surprisingly rested this morning.

I had a productive day at work and a big feed of spaghetti at lunch.  By the time I was heading out the door to go to the track, I was getting a bit hungry (or maybe it was nerves).
<!---->
The warmup was uneventful and everything was working (ankles, soleus'); the strides felt good too.  The 15 minutes at marathon pace was **comfortable** too; it took me about a lap to slow down into the 5:08-5:15 target pace and I finished this effort at 5:07/km.

My goal for the 8x400m was 1:42 per 400m.  This proved harder than I thought.  On the first rep, I hit the 200m about 3 seconds ahead of schedule and to get my timing right, I slowed down too much on the back half.  That rep ended a touch slow at 1:43.6 (4:22/km) but point being, I'd like to be closer to 51 seconds at the 200m mark.

Then I sort of got into a bit of a pickle.

The local Harriors Junior Team had rented the track tonight.  The coach asked other people to clear the track for their workout but he didn't approach me and seemed very much ok with what I was doing; maybe I _"look"_ like a runner.  I mean, it was at this very track that someone asked if I was a _"triathlete"_ and look what I am doing now.
<!---->
Back to the pickle...  For the remaining 7 reps, I was now sharing the track with a group of fast kids and that didn't do me any favours in trying to trying to hit 51 seconds per 200 or my goal of 1:42 per 400m.  Every remaining effort was either a touch too fast or just plain too fast.  Running fast is FUN and tonight was **a lot of fun** but in re-reading the workout description after the fact, I see that there was an explicit instruction to _"not to go faster than 1:42"_.

Physically I feel really good after the workout but if there is a workout I'd want a do over...
