Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 22 minutes   
Run 1:40 on rolling or hilly terrain. Trails or the Goose (further out) would be nice; effort, EASY.    
_Stay well fueled. Minimum of 300 calories on this run._ 

### NOTES
Total Time: **100 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **10 miles**

Another sound sleep; nice!  I made a great tasting coffee and had a sweet pastry before heading out for today's run.

I wasn't 10 minutes down the road when the rain started to fall.  Funny thing, I am happy to run in the rain but if I have to ride in the stuff, it becomes a procrastination show.  I had an idea of the direction I wanted to run to get in a hillier route but nothing concrete.  I darted of into the subdivision behind the View Royal Fire Hall and is was wonderfully hilly.

The rain became heavier the closer I got to Colwood so once out of that sub-division, I doubled back to work in the up and downs of Helmcken Road.  I stayed on Helmcken, past the Hospital and started making my way home through the Knockan Hill area of Wilkinson Road.  The flattest section of today's run was the last 10 minutes on the Goose.  

I had gels at the 20, 50 and 70 minute marks and drank about 300ml of plain water.  I took it easy when going uphill and refrained from smashing myself when going down.  Overall, I **felt great** from start to finish.  I ran a bit extra to make today an even 10 miles.

## CANADIAN THANKSGIVING DAY ‚òÄÔ∏è
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **4**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
15 Minutes of mobility

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

I was rolling with the lacrosse ball during the Seahawks game last night and I found a new hotspot on the lateral side of my left soleus.  The hotspots from last week (right quad, right glute med) have worked themselves out.

Last night I slept soundly.

I took the day to get some light work around the yard in.  The trellis for my beans was blown oven by yesterday's wind and heartbreakingly, my surf ski was damaged bu the windstorm too; there is a spiderweb of cracks in the carbon fibre.  I am sure the I can repair it but it will be a lot of work and I am not sure if the repair would cost more that a new boat.  Bummer because I was hoping to get in a paddle today.
