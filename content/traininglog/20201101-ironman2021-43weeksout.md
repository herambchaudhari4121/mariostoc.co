### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility: 23 minutes.    
Ride 1:45-2:00 on road bike. Flat to rolling. Keep the effort easy.

### NOTES
Total Moving Time: **135 minutes**  
Distance: **58 km**

Posterior from the lumbar to my calves feels worked over (in a good way) but my left glute and hamstring is tender.

Then I jump on the bike.  I figured a loop around YYJ gets me the time and route profile needed for today.  There was a light breeze from the north but the sun was out and I was feeling **really good**!  I took a bit of time at Patricia Bay before heading south.  I also had a tube decided to stop holding air on the way back that broke up the flow of my ride.

Seahawks thumps the 49ers too; **great day**.
