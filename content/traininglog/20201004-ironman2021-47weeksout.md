Sleep **4** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **2** | Soreness **3**  
<sup>Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 90 minutes: 20 minutes easy running to warm up. 8x 200 strides @ 5k effort/pace @ 51-54 seconds per 200, 100 as 20 meters slowing to a walk, 60 meters walking, 20 meters shuffling back to a run. 3x 10 minutes @ 1/2 marathon effort/feel (lets aim for 5:08-5:15 per km) 5 minutes WALKING after each effort. 10 minutes easy jogging to cool down.

_Ideally you'll do this on the track and you'll have at least 200 calories on hand. AND enough water_.

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes** &nbsp; Distance: **15 km**

I went to bed early last night but didn't have the best sleep.  I was up for a bathroom break and had a night sweats too.  When morning did come, I did have a big pancake breakfast to start the day off on a better note.

For the 20 minute warmup, I jogged to the track at Esquimalt High.  The first set of 200s had a target of 51 seconds.  I ran **51.4**, **50.6**, **51.9**, **50.2**, **50.9**, **50.5**, **50.9** and **50.3**; these felt smooth and comfortable.

After a quick sip of water, the tempo efforts of 3x10 minutes began; my target pace was 5:08/km.  The first effort was run at **5:08/km**.  I had a gel while in the recovery time before the 2nd 10 minute rep.  The next 2 reps went by quickly and I found a comfortable rhythm at **5:10/km** for both.

While I jogged comfortably home at last year's marathon pace, I got a text message from Mike McD. in Calgary to let me know that while I was doing this workout, he had bested my 10K PB.
