# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021

This part of my website contains a series of weekly updates 
aimed at sharing my experience as I build toward completing my
first IRONMAN distance triathon. I hope it is relevant for:

* Friends and family wanting to know why I can't do _[activity]_ on weekends anymore.
* Those embarked on their own similar journey and want to read about my process.
* My boss who may be wondering _"the real reason"_ we are getting too close to our project's deadline.

Most importantly, this training log is relevant for me, as a 
record and reminder of this experience, the hurdles faced, the
victories won, the learnings and the bonds formed along the 
way.

My [current week of training](latest) can be found [here](latest).

The [list of completed weeks](javascript:flkty.select(3);) can be found [here](javascript:flkty.select(3);).
