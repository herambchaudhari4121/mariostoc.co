# IRONMAN TRAINING 2021

This part of my website contains a series of weekly updates 
aimed at sharing my experience as I build toward completing my
first IRONMAN distance triathon. I hope it is relevant for:

* Friends and family wanting to know why I can't do _[activity]_ on weekends anymore.
* Those embarked on their own journey and want to read about my process.
* My boss who may be wondering the real reason we are getting too close to our project's deadline.

Most importantly, this training log is relevant for me, as a 
record and reminder of this experience, the hurdles faced, the
victories won, the learnings and the bonds formed along the 
way.
