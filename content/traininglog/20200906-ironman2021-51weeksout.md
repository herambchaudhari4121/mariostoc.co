### NOTES

I thought I'd do my old Vanalman route but the city has a connecting trail closed so I was left to improvise a route.  I made my way towards Christmas Hill and did a half lap of Swan  Lake.  Pace was easy and this was the right length of time for me to have been on my feet.  I was feeling it on the uphills but finished feeling strong on the last km.
