## SUNDAY SEP 06
Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **2** | Soreness **5** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Run 50 minutes, rolling route, easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **55 minutes**

I thought I'd do my old Vanalman route but the city has a 
connecting trail closed so I was left to improvise a route. 
I made my way towards Christmas Hill and did a half lap of 
Swan  Lake.  Pace was easy and this was the right length of 
time for me to have been on my feet.  I was feeling it on 
the uphills but finished feeling strong on the last km.

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 22 minutes.

### NOTES
Total Time: **0 minutes**

Good sleep last night but I do have a touch of fatigue in my legs (feels good).

Today may have been a break from a scheduled workout but I was active finishing the siding project that I had on the go.  That is one thing off the plate and will allow me a bit more free time to get some training in.

## TUESDAY SEP 08
Sleep **3** | Fatigue **3** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Mobility 25 minutes. &mdash; Run 30 minutes, flatter route, easy effort.

### NOTES
Total Time: **30 minutes**

I didn’t sleep as well as I would have liked; I am guessing that it was the sawdust from yesterday’s work on the shed.  I did have my run kit ready to go for a pre-coffee easy run but I put it off until later; the skys are thick with wildfire smoke from Eastern WA.

The smoke cleared a bit after work so I did a lap of Swan Lake.  The first 7 minutes sucked with heavy legs (calves, soleus in particular) but I did find a groove after that and finished feeling strong.  I mostly breathed through my nose to limit the effort with the lingering smoke in the air.

Sleep **2** | Fatigue **4** | Stress **3** | Soreness **3** 
<sup><br />Rate on an scale 1-7 &nbsp; 1=best 7=worst &nbsp; +5 is a warning</sup>

### PLANNED WORKOUT
Ride 60 minutes, easy and keep it fun.  
Run 30 minutes OTB, easy pace. 

### NOTES
Total Time: **90 minutes**

I feel  like I slept better last night and I had a good day at work.  In fact, I wish I could have a day like today _every day_.  Yesterday's smoke cleared and the weather couldn't have been better.  25&#8451; and sunny and it felt like Maui in December.

The stipulation for the ride was _"fun"_; which rhymes with _"Munn"_ except Prospect Lake Road was the much better option. The first few pedal strokes on the bike felt laboured but I soon found a groove and the ride ended up feeling good to great overall. Coming down Hampton Road, I got out of my shoes and nailed a dismount in the driveway.

<!---->
Off the bike, I went right into my Nikes, stuffed the bike in the garage and headed off to Lochside Trail toward Quadra Street. I didn't feel much of the typical jelly legs coming off the bike but I certainly _did_ feel yesterday's run. That feeling of fatigue was greatest at the top of the Switch Bridge and didn't subside until the last 5 minutes; things went from sucking pretty bad to actually feeling strong.
 
I suprised myself with a **5:30/km** average pace.

I had a good vegetarian dinner and it is now time for bed.

Ride Distance: **24.90 km** &nbsp; Elevation: **284 m**
