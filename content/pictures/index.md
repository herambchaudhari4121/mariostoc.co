# Pictures I've Taken

Inspired by the online content produced by Ted Forbes, _"The Art of Photography"_,
Trey Ratcliff, _"Stuck in Customs"_ and most importantly, personally motivated by
my uncle and friend, Carmen Stocco, I picked up a camera with the hopes of
capturing the amazing beauty of this corner of the world that I call home.

Some of the pictures were taken with my Sony NEX-7, some with whatever generation
of iPhone I had at the time.  There are even a few taken with an old GoPro Hero3.

I hope you enjoy the view.

Beyond my own backyard, I also traveled to Europe in 2018.
Here are some of the images from that trip:
