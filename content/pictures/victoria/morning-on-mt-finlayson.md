# Morning on Mount Finlayson

Standing 419m (1,375ft) tall and to the northwest of Victoria, 
Mount Finlayson is located within the Gowlland Range (part of 
the Vancouver Island Ranges). It is a neighbour to Goldstream 
and Gowlland Tod Provincial Parks. A short but steep trail 
leads up to the summit and that is where I took this picture 
one early autumn morning.
