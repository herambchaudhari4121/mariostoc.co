2020 Cobble Hill 10K
Sunday, January 26th, 2020

The weather forecast was wrong and the +600 participants of this year’s Cobble Hill 10K were the better for it.  This was one of those Cowichan Valley winter days the local residents enjoy while wearing a tee-shirt and shorts while the rest of Canada is bundled up and dealing with below freezing temperatures.

Starting at George Bonner School, the course is scenic, country roads around Cobble Hill. It has produced some fast times for many runners. Hosted by the CEEVACS Road Runners, course records are 30:46 (Geoff Martinson) and 34:44 (Cheryl Murphy).

Jonas and I set off with the crowd.  

The out and back on looked and felt less hilly than what we jogged on the warmup.


Optically challenging false flat leading to up the turnaround at Hutchinson Road.  The road back, was just the opposite.  The very gradual climb is now a very gradual descent.  I kept my effort the same and enjoyed the uptick in pace.  

The course left Cobble Hill Road for a rolling section through kilometres 8 and 9. 
Jonas looked at me as if he wanted permission to crank it up for the finish.  I said, “Yes, go for it!” and I watched him lengthen his stride on the was to the finish.  I started my push too but there wasn’t much pop left in my legs.  As Jonas disappeared up the road, I resigned to pushing as best I could and maintaining form.

Strides on Friday?

Hit the line with a new Personal Best of 47 minutes, 14 seconds.
