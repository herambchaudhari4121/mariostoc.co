Static Website Generator for https://mariostoc.co

My personal website is an ongoing experiment in communication design.  It serves as a testing ground for new coding ideas as well as giving me a platform for sharing a little about me.  The site has gone from plain text, to Flash, to a _very brief_ stint on WordPress, to a custom Python CMS delivering XHTML.  The latest direction for my website is going to HTML5, a more touch-friendly UI and this Static Site Generation project.

### Inspiration
Earlier in 2018, I helped a colleague migrate his website from WordPress to a static site hosted in Azure.  That started the wheels in motion for this project.  There are many Static Site Generators that I could have chosen from, but the fun (for me) has always been, creating my own.    

### Project Goals
1. Horizontal, minimal layout that works with a touch interface.
2. Easy blog post/photo gallery creation by creating a simple Markdown file.
3. ...
4. ~~Profit?~~ _(not with this one)_

### In the Future...
Add automation specific to the tools/apps on my iPadPro.Use Shortcuts to automate tasks on iPad
The Shortcuts app n/a lets you automate tasks you do often with just a tap or by asking Siri. Create shortcuts to get directions to the next event in your Calendar, move text from one app to another, and more. Choose ready-made shortcuts from the Gallery or build your own using different apps to run multiple steps in a task.
